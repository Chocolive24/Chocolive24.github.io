This project is a deferred rendering 3D scene including Physically Based Rendering (PBR) and Image Based Lighting (IBL) made with a from scratch graphics engine using OpenGL.
I carried out this project during a computer graphics module in the 2nd year of my bachelor's degree at SAE-Institute-Geneva. The aim of the project was to learn the different techniques for rendering graphics based on rasterisation.

Here is a short showcase video:

Here are different renderings of my scene:
<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/3d_scene/images/scene_cover.png" alt="" />
  <img src="/3d_scene/images/gold_sphere_cover.png" alt="" />
  <img src="/3d_scene/images/chest_cover.png" alt="" />
  <p style="margin-top: -30px"><em></em></p>
</div>

<br>Here are all the techniques and functionalities contained in my scene:
- OBJ Model Loading
- Instancing
- Face and Frustum Culling
- Cubemap
- Deferred Shading
- Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
- Shadow Mapping
    - Directional Light Shadow Map
    - Point Light Shadow Cubemap
- Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
    - Image Based Lighting (IBL)
    - Directional Light
    - Point Light
- Emissive Textures Mapping
- Physically Based Bloom
- High Dynamic Range (HDR) + Tone Mapping + Gamma Correction
