## Context
This game was created during the **Orbital Game Jam 6 - Mirkwood Edition**. We had **24 hours** to create a game on the **visual theme** of **Mirkwood** and the **gameplay theme everything is temporary**.

**Basically** we wanted to make a **climbing game with ragdoll** in the trees of Mirkwood. **Unfortunately** we **didn't manage** to **get a good ragdoll** and decided to **restart a game from scratch**. 

The **result** was a **game** that took **6 hours** to make, where you simply have to **barricade** the **windows** of a house to **protect yourself** from the Mirkwood **monsters** that are trying to get in. **We developed** the game **from 10pm to 4am** and were therefore **very tired**, which is why we put images of ourselves as screamers in the game. Although **we were a little disappointed** with our performance at the jam, **we had a lot of laughs**.
