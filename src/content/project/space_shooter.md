<div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-justify">

This project was my **first C++ game project** carried out during a **course module** on **C++ Game Programming Basics** at **SAE Institut Geneva** in the **1st year of the Games Programming bachelor's degree**.

The **goal** was to create a **space shooter game** in **C++** with **SFML** as graphics API and **Box2D** as physics engine.
