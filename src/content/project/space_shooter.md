## Context
This project was my **first C++ game project** carried out during a **course module** on **C++ Game Programming Basics** at **SAE Institut Geneva** in the **1st year of the Games Programming bachelor's degree**.

The **goal** was to create a **space shooter game** in **C++** with **SFML** as graphics API and **Box2D** as physics engine.

## Showcase
Here is a gameplay video:

## What did I learn ?
- The basics of C++ Programming
- Concept of polymorphism
- Displaying images and text with a graphics API (SFML)
- Using a physics engine (Box2D)
- Playing sounds in code
