## Context
Ruby and the Lost Crystals is a game project produced as part of the third year of the Bachelor's programme in Games Programming at SAE-Institut in Geneva. The project is a collaboration between the school's Game Programming, Game Art, and Audio Engineering departments. It served as the main project for the Game Programmers, while for the Game Artists and Audio Engineers, it was a side project alongside their other coursework.

The aim was to produce a vertical slice in six months (from September to February), enabling us to demonstrate gameplay that is representative of the game's final concept.
The aim of the project is to have a semi-professional experience where each discipline plays an essential role in production and where students can specialise in one aspect of game development.
