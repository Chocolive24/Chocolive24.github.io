## Context
Ruby and the Lost Crystals is a **game project** produced as part of the **third year of the Bachelor's programme in Games Programming at SAE-Institut in Geneva**. The project is a **collaboration** between the school's **Game Programming, Game Art, and Audio Engineering departments**. It served as the **main project for the Game Programmers**, while for the Game Artists and Audio Engineers, it was a side project alongside their other coursework.

The aim was to produce a **vertical slice in six months** (from September to February), enabling us to demonstrate gameplay that is representative of the game's final concept.
The aim of the project is to have a **semi-professional experience** where each discipline plays an essential role in production and where **students can specialise in one aspect of game development**.

## Blog Post  
The games programming team has written a blog post to give an update on the development of the project:  [Read it here](/blog/ruby-and-the-lost-crystals-project-debrief)

I wrote another blog post about my graphics stylisation process on the game:  [Read it here](/blog/my-stylization-process-for-ruby-and-the-lost-crystals-using-a-physically-based-cel-shader)

Finally I wrote a post-mortem:  [Read it here](/blog/ruby-and-the-lost-crystals-post-mortem)
