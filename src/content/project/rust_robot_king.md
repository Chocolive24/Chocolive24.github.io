## Context
This game was created during the **Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023**. We had **one week** to make a **first person grid based dungeon crawler game**. The **theme** of the Jam was **"Duality"**. We used **Unreal 4** to develop the game. Personally, it was the **first time** I had **developed a game on Unreal**

We decided to make a **Dungeon Crawler** in which there are rooms with enemies that we **fight in turn-based battle** using **attacks based on key combos**. For the **artistic direction**, we opted for a **pixelated 3D rendering** similar to **old PS1** games.

## Showcase
Play as a robot whose mission is to make a choice about the fate of robots abandoned after a heavy battle organized by humans. Discover the 2 different factions of robots left behind in a derelict spaceship and listen to what they have to say to choose which side you will help.

Here is a short showcase video (Unfortunately, the game has a bug that causes combat to crash and freezes the player):
