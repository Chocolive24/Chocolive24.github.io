## Context
This game was created during the **GMTK Game Jam 2023**. We had **48 hours** to create a game on the **theme** of **"roles reversed"**. 

We decided to make a **Tower Defence game** where, **instead of playing the strategist** who places towers using his mouse, **we play a tower** in the **first-person** that had been placed on the battlefield. **After each wave** of enemies, the player's mouse can be seen in the sky placing **other towers**, which are **AIs** that **help us** defeat the monsters.
