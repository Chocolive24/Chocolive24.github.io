## Context
This project was carried out during a **course module** on **Unity Programming** and **Game Design** at **SAE Institut Geneva** in the **1st year of the Games Programming bachelor's degree**.

The **goal** was to create a **platform game with collectibles** and **multiple levels**. We also had to design **original gameplay** and **introduce it** effectively to the player through **thoughtful Game Design**.

I decided to make a **platform game where gravity can go in all directions**. The player can **walk all around certain mini planets**.

## Showcase
Here is a short gameplay video:

## What did I learn ?
- The Basics of Unity Programming
- Introducing game mechanics with Rational Game Design
- Provide visual and audio game feedback
- The basics of linear algebra to apply gravity of different directions to my player.
- Create managers to handle the different game systems
