## Context
This **group project** was carried out during a **course module on low-level C++ programming** and the creation of **game tools and engines** at **SAE Institut Geneva** in the **1st year of the Games Programming bachelor's degree**.

The aim was to **continue developing** our [from scratch game engine](/project/bopys-puzzle-adventure--runner-game) that we had started at the **beginning of the same course module**. The **city builder was a pretext** for **adding new features** to the **game engine** such as: **Rule tiles** for our tilemap editor, **Hot Reload**, **data serialization** and a **bit of multithreading** for the game's IAs.

I was **personally in charge of** the **graphic code**, such as the **game's camera and UI** as well as the **hot reload system**.

## Showcase
Here is a gameplay video of the game:

Here is a video demonstration of the game engine's Hot Reload system:
