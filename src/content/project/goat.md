<div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-justify">

This game was created during the **Ludum Dare 54 in 2023**. We had **48 hours** to create a game on the **theme** of **"limited space"**. 

We decided to make a **Bullet Hell game** where you control a goat attached by a rope who must dodge objects thrown at him by an angry crowd.

# <div class="text-center mt-16">What did I learn ?</div>

<div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-justify">

- To work under the stress of timing
- To work as part of a team
  - Brainstorming as a group
  - Sharing tasks
  - Integrating my colleagues' assets
- 4 Programmers is too much for a small jam like that. 
  - We wasted too much time with git conflicts and tasks performed by several people more than once.
