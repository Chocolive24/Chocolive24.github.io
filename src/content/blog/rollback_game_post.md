## Intro

## Technical direction.

For the network part of my game, I decided to use the [photon realtime](https://www.photonengine.com/realtime) library. I chose it because photon provides free servers that we can use via their library. But also because the library provides ready-made rooms and a ready-made client. Given that the project focuses on the implementation of a rollback system, this aspect of the library appealed to me in order to reduce the network code workload.

## Project architecture.

### Different executables

intro qui parle de la class Engine.

#### Simulation application.

#### Client application.

#### Split screen application.

### Systems.

    parler du local et online game manager.
    parler du game render qui point le local game manager.

### Network.

    parler des packets et autre

## Rollback implementation.

### Systems separation.

    Input system
    LocalGameManager
    PlayerManager
    ProjectileManager
    Rappel sur le game renderer qui est Ã  part.

### Resimulate the game.

    Why not une frame sans confirm frame qui prouve le probleme de ressimuler depuis la frame 0.
